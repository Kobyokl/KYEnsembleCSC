Welcome to the Learn page!


(The button in the bottom right returns you to the previous page)

Here, there are a variety of instruments that you click on to view information about them.

This information entails where the instruments are from, how they work, what genres they're used
in and their role in the music world today!

Upon hitting the begin button, try to catch one of the instruments by clicking on it and read what the information has to offer.

Upon clicking an instrument, there's always a path to another instrument, so dont try to hit the back button to click another instrument !

If two textboxes show up at one time. Click the instrument that you want to see again and that will fix the problem 

(This really only happens if you try to click the instruments as fast as you can before the camera gets to the instrument you first clicked on)

I hope you enjoy this presentation of information! When you're done try going back and generating your own music! (if you haven't already).

This is the piano!
<br>
<br>
A piano is a musical instrument that produces sound by striking strings with hammers. It typically consists of a keyboard with 88 keys, which are arranged in a specific pattern of black and white keys. The white keys represent the natural notes of the musical scale (A, B, C, D, E, F, G), while the black keys represent the sharp and flat notes (A#/Bb, C#/Db, D#/Eb, F#/Gb, G#/Ab).
<br>
<br>
When a key on the piano is pressed, a mechanism called the action causes a hammer to strike a string, producing a musical tone. The player can control the loudness and duration of the tone by varying the force and duration of the key press. The piano is capable of producing a wide range of dynamic and expressive sounds, from soft and delicate to loud and powerful.
<br>
<br>
The piano is a versatile instrument that is commonly used in a variety of musical genres, including classical, jazz, pop, and rock. It can be played solo or as part of an ensemble, and is often used as a accompaniment instrument for vocals or other instruments.
<br>
<br>
The piano has a rich history dating back to the early 18th century, and has undergone many changes and innovations over the years. Today, it remains a popular and widely used instrument, prized for its versatility, expressiveness, and timeless beauty.

Drums have been an important part of music for thousands of years, with evidence of drumming dating back to ancient civilizations. They have been used in religious ceremonies, as well as for communication and entertainment. In more recent times, the drums have played a pivotal role in the development of modern music, particularly in genres such as rock and roll, where the drum beat is often the driving force behind the music.
<br>

The drums are a versatile and expressive instrument that can create a wide range of sounds and rhythms. From the thundering sound of the bass drum to the shimmering tones of the cymbals, the drums are capable of producing an incredible range of sounds and emotions.

This is the Guitar
<br>
<br>
The guitar is a popular musical instrument that is played by plucking or strumming the strings with the fingers or a pick. It is a versatile instrument that can be used in a wide range of musical genres, from classical and jazz to rock and pop music. The guitar has a long history that dates back to ancient times, and over the centuries it has evolved into a complex and sophisticated instrument.
<br>
<br>
There are several types of guitars, including acoustic and electric guitars. Acoustic guitars are made entirely of wood and have a hollow body that resonates when the strings are plucked. Electric guitars, on the other hand, have a solid body and are equipped with pickups that convert the vibrations of the strings into electrical signals that can be amplified and played through speakers.
<br>
<br>
Playing the guitar requires a combination of skill, technique, and musical expression. Beginners typically start by learning basic chords and strumming patterns, while more advanced players can perform complex fingerstyle arrangements and solos. Learning to play the guitar also involves developing a good sense of rhythm and timing, as well as a deep understanding of music theory.
<br>
<br>
The guitar has played a significant role in the development of many music genres, from blues and rock and roll to country and folk music. Some of the most famous guitarists of all time include Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Eddie Van Halen, and Carlos Santana, each known for their unique styles and contributions to the instrument. 
<br>
<br>
Today, the guitar continues to be a popular instrument that is enjoyed by millions of people around the world, and its versatility and expressive qualities make it a staple in virtually every style of music.

This is the Saxophone!
<br>
<br>        
A saxophone is a versatile and expressive musical instrument that is part of the woodwind family. It is made of brass and has a distinctive curved shape that tapers at the bottom. The saxophone is played by blowing air through a mouthpiece that has a reed attached to it. The reed vibrates when air is blown through it, producing a unique sound that can be shaped and modulated by the player's breath and the placement of their fingers on the instrument's keys.
<br>
<br>
Saxophones come in a range of sizes, from the smallest soprano saxophone to the largest bass saxophone. The most commonly used saxophones are the alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones. Each size has its own distinct sound and range, with the alto saxophone being the most common in jazz and popular music, while the tenor saxophone is commonly used in rock and roll and R&B music.
<br>
<br>
Playing the saxophone requires skill, technique, and a good sense of breath control and musical expression. The instrument has a wide range of sounds and effects that can be produced by the player, from soft and smooth to loud and raspy. To play the saxophone well, the player must learn to control their breath and embouchure (the way they shape their lips and mouth around the mouthpiece), as well as master the fingering and key positions of the instrument.
<br>
<br>
The saxophone has become an iconic symbol of jazz and popular music, with many famous saxophonists such as Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, and Stan Getz known for their virtuosic performances on the instrument. Today, the saxophone is still widely used in many genres of music, from classical to rock and roll to hip hop. Its expressive sound and versatility make it a popular choice for soloists and ensemble players alike.
